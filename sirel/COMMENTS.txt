=========================  Sirel PHP Library  ============================
===========================================================================

A word "sirel" stands for "lilac" in Estonian.

The sirel library is pretty general and contains a mixture of various
things that one might need for building a server side software.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The only reason, why the current version has been published, 
    is to demonstrate that I, Martin.Vahi@softf1.com, have been
    working working with PHP extensively. 

    Sub-parts of it are pretty tried and tested and I as the 
    original author of this library have been using it for production,
    but the whole library needs HEAVY REFACTORING and
    one really needs to know one's way around the library to use it.

    So please, don't even try to use the current version of it 
    for anything useful, other than entertainment, because it really 
    needs to be prepared for others to use.

    Actually, the text below this line also needs to be updated a little.

                             Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sirel PHP Library is a mixture of PHP5 subroutines/classes that are
meant to facilitate the writing of web applications.

To use the whole library, one should "require_once" the ./src/sirel.php.
As each of the Sirel PHP Library files includes, "requires once",
all of the other Sirel PHP Library files that it depends on.
It's also possible to use the library by "requiring once" only
the files that one finds immanently necessary.

Code examples are provided in a form of small demo-applications that
reside in ./doc/usage_examples

                              Dependencies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mandatory dependencies for client code:

        - The Sirel PHP library has been written in PHP 5.2.

        - The PHP mbstring extension. 
              The sirel_core.php switches the internal string 
              representation to UTF-8 and all of the library 
              source relies on an assumption that the internal 
              string representation is UTF-8.

        - Perl 5.10
              Given that the PHP is Turing Complete, one can not 
              claim that the PHP lacks functionality, but 
              due to speed considerations Perl 5.10 is used for 
              some string operations that are not that well 
              supported by the mbstring extension.

        - The PHP GNU Multiple Precision extension (GMP extension).

Optional dependencies for client code:

        - Memcached support.


Client code dependencies that are shipped with the Sirel PHP library:

        - spyc library (http://code.google.com/p/spyc/ ),
          which provides YAML (http://www.yaml.org/ ) support.

Dependencies for developing (modifying) the Sirel PHP library:

        - Ruby (http://ruby-lang.org/ )

        - Kibuvits Ruby Library (http://rubyforge.org/projects/kibuvits/ )


In order to use the Sirel library, one also needs to add some configuration
code to one's PHP-souce. For example, one has to furnish sirel with the
database username and password.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Some of the Files in the ./src
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

sirel.php         --- An inclusion file for client applications that want
                      to use the whole library. This file should
                      be "included" ("required once") by any of the sirel's
                      own files. It also contains a description of sirel
                      file dependencies.

sirel_core.php    --- The core of the sirel library. All other sirel
                      library PHP-files depend on that file.

sirel_lang.php    --- Mainly type verification routines and string
                      operations, but it also deals with Memcached daemon.

sirel_db.php      --- Database engine abstraction. It provides an SQL
                      interface that does not depend on any of the
                      supported database engine. The idea is that if one
                      wants to port the web-application from one database
                      engine to another, one just updates the database
                      engine name, port and password in the config file
                      and everything just runs fluently. Even data types
                      are abstracted away, because different database
                      engines use slightly different type names. :-)

sirel_dbcomm.php  --- Much higher level database access abstraction than
                      the sirel_db.php. The sirel_db.php
                      abstracted away the database engine specific issues,
                      but sirel_dbcomm.php depends on the sirel_db.php
                      and implements an interface, where the
                      SQL statements are assembled automatically
                      from hashtables.

sirel_resource.php--- Routines that are related to user interface media.
                      For example user interface messages, menu item
                      names in different languages, etc.

sirel_security.php--- It does not deal with only crypto related issues.

sirel_html.php    --- Practically it provides a class, sirelHTMLPage,
                      that has a method "to_s()", which prints out
                      a string representation of a HTML page. Different
                      regions of the HTML page are public
                      fields of the class sirelHTMLPage.

sirel_request_handling.php ---
                      Just some rather high-level stuff that seem
                      to fit nowhere else.
